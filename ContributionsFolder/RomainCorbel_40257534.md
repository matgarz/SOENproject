Dates: Sept 13-Sept 17: 
I was involved in the initial 20 minutes meeting after class. 
With the discord server online for communication, I helped decide what languages and framwework may be used for the project.
I regularly discussed and checked the work being done on the github(roughly 20 minutes per session).

Sept 18: 
I attended the second group meeting where the finalisation of the projects frameworks and languages was going to be used for the project. 
I also began creating some user stories for the functionalities of the application (2 hours).

Sept 25: 
I created a meetings minutes document and request a pull of a folder containing all meeting minutes for sprint 1(30 minutes). 
At the lab tonight, the final details for sprint 1 will be finalised.

Overall time spent on project so far: 
20min + 20min*9days + 2hours + 0.5hour = 5 hours and 50 minutes.
