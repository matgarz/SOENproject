US #11: As a student I need a unique qr-code for my ticket
Conversation:
Each ticket must generate a unique QR code upon purchase.
QR code contains enough info to validate at the event (ticket ID, event ID, student ID).
Question: should QR code encode all info (event name, seat, etc.) or just an ID that the server checks?
QR codes should be viewable in the wallet and downloadable as an image.
Validation process: organizer scans QR → backend checks ticket validity (not reused/expired).
Security: prevent duplicate/fake QR codes.
Confirmation (Acceptance Criteria):
Each purchased ticket has a unique QR code assigned.
QR code can be displayed in the wallet.
QR code can be downloaded/saved (image format).
When scanned, QR code correctly validates against backend and shows “valid/invalid.”
A used/expired ticket’s QR code is rejected.
